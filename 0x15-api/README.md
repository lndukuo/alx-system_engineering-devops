# API Project

## Background

This project involves creating Python scripts to interact with an API to access and export employee data in different formats. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in using Python for tasks traditionally handled by Bash scripting, and to understand and work with APIs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what Bash scripting should not be used for
- Understand what an API is and how it works
- Understand the concept of a REST API
- Understand what microservices are
- Explain the CSV and JSON data formats
- Adhere to Pythonic naming conventions and style

## Resources

To help you with this project, refer to the following resources:

- [Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script](https://example.com)
- [What is an API](https://example.com)
- [What is an API? In English, please](https://example.com)
- [What is a REST API](https://example.com)
- [What are microservices](https://example.com)
- [PEP8 Python style](https://example.com)

## Requirements

- **Editors:** Allowed editors are `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`.
- **Python Version:** All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **File Ending:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Library Imports:** Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
- **Executable Files:** All your files must be executable.
- **Code Style:** Use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) to ensure code style adherence.
- **Documentation:** All modules must have documentation.
- **Dictionary Access:** Use `.get()` to access dictionary values by key.
- **Module Execution:** Code should not execute when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Make sure you have Python 3.8.5 installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Run Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts directly from the command line.

3. **Documentation**: Ensure that each module contains appropriate documentation.
